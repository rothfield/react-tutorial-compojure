Yes-ter-day  all my trou-bles seemed so far a-way
now it looks as though they're here to stay oh I be-lieve in Yes-ter-day
sudd-en-ly  I'm  not half the  man I used  to be
theres a sha-dow hang-ing o-ver me Oh I be-lieve in Yes-ter-day
why she had to go I don't know she would-n't say
I said some-thing wrong now I long for yes-ter-day day
